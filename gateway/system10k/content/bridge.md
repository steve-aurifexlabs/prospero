### Description
Write code together in real-time. Great for pair programming, live code reviews,
or anytime you write code together.

Jump from branch to branch in real-time. Real-time branching leads to dynamic
team interaction, and is the heart of real-time source control.

Review changes and resolve conflicts in real-time. Improve your team's workflow
and code quality by dealing with issues as they happen.

Changes to local files sync immediately using a filesystem watcher so you can
seamlessly edit files with your favorite desktop tools.

Most importantly, it must work really well; be perfectly intuitive and disappear
as your team slips into a state of flow.

### Motivation
It's time for a new way to think about how we work together. Not just for the
sake of productivity, but developers' quality of life.

The workflow du jour looks something like Git+Slack with daily standups
sprinkled in. If we weren't meant to sit in cubicles all day listening to eight
different bosses drone on about mission statements, why are we ok with open
workspaces where every developer is wearing headphones and chatting on Slack?

We use systems that relegate leaders to dolling out tasks and reviewing other
people's code all day while being foisted with responsibility and stress until
burnout sets in.

Rather than have meetings, have work sessions. Instead of quick questions that
interupt flow, set aside time to work on what's important together. You can't be
interupted if you're actually working together.

We should write code together. Talk to each other. Sit next to each other. And
to do this we need the right tools.


Thoughts
--------

I have built about a half dozen prototypes of this system. It is tough to get right.
