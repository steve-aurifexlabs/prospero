    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

    <p>Last updated: March 14, 2020</p>

    <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the aurifexlabs.com and prospero.live
        websites (the "Service") operated by Aurifex Labs LLC ("us", "we", or "our").</p>

    <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms.
        These
        Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Service.</p>

    <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the
        terms
        then you do not have permission to access the Service.</p>

    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>

    <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance
        on a
        recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a monthly basis.</p>

    <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions
        unless
        you cancel it or Aurifex Labs LLC cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your
        online
        account management page or by contacting Aurifex Labs LLC customer support team.</p>

    <p>A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You
        shall
        provide Aurifex Labs LLC with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state,
        zip
        code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you
        automatically authorize Aurifex Labs LLC to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any
        such
        payment instruments.</p>

    <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Aurifex Labs LLC will issue an electronic invoice
        indicating
        that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the
        billing
        period as indicated on the invoice.</p>

    <h2>Fee Changes</h2>

    <p>Aurifex Labs LLC, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the
        Subscriptions.
        Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>

    <p>Aurifex Labs LLC will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you
        an
        opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>

    <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement
        to
        pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>


    <h2>Refunds</h2>

    <p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>

    <h2>Accounts</h2>

    <p>When you create an account with us, you guarantee that you are above the age of 18, and that the information you
        provide us is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Inaccurate, incomplete, or obsolete information may
        result in the immediate termination of your account on the Service.</p>

    <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, including but not limited
        to
        the restriction of access to your computer and/or account. You agree to accept responsibility for any and all
        activities or actions that occur under your account and/or password, whether your password is with our Service
        or a
        third-party service. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or
        unauthorized
        use of your account.</p>

    <p>You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity or that is not lawfully available for use, a
        name
        or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity other than you, without appropriate
        authorization. You may not use as a username any name that is offensive, vulgar or obscene.</p>

        to a breach of the Terms.</p>

    <p>If you wish to terminate your account, you must contact the Aurifex Labs LLC customer support team.</p>

    <p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination,
        including,

    <h2>Indemnification</h2>

    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Aurifex Labs LLC and its licensee and licensors, and their
        employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages,
        obligations,
        losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees), resulting from
        or

        b) a
        breach of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>Limitation Of Liability</h2>

    <p>In no event shall Aurifex Labs LLC, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be
        liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation,
        loss
        of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or
        inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii)
        any
        content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or
        content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or
        not
        we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have
        failed of its essential purpose.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>

    <p>Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis.
        The
        Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to,
        implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement or course of
        performance.</p>

    <h2>Exclusions</h2>

    <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability
        for
        consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>

    <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Virginia, United States, without
        regard
        to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

    <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If
        any
        provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these
        Terms
        will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and
        supersede
        and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>

    <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is
        material we will provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a
        material
        change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>

    <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the
        revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Service.</p>
